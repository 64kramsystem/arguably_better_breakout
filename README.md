# Arguably Better Breakout

Experimental ground for my Bevy studies, based on Alice I. Cecile's [Better Breakout](https://github.com/alice-i-cecile/bevy/tree/better-breakout).

As of 14/Jul/2021, the main changes are:

- split the project in modules;
- implemented states (WIP, but working).

In the future I may (or not) write a follow-up article on the experiments.
